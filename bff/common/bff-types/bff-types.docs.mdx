# The shared types between the service and the client
This module only contains type definitions that are shared between both the service and the client application (react app).

The types for this example are quite basic:

```typescript 

type PersonType = {
    name: string,
    age: number,
    address: string
}

type ServiceResponseType = PersonType[]

export {ServiceResponseType, PersonType}
```
